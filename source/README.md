## Installing

### By adding to your .nimble file

```
requires "delight >= 0.1.0"
```

### Via command-line

```
$ nimble install delight
```

## Usage

Let's start with some boilerplate:

```nim
import delight
import glm

proc rectangle(x, y, w, h: float): array[4, LineSegment] =
  result = [
    (a: vec2(x, y),         b: vec2(x + w, y)),
    (a: vec2(x + w, y),     b: vec2(x + w, y + h)),
    (a: vec2(x + w, y + h), b: vec2(x, y + h)),
    (a: vec2(x, y + h),     b: vec2(x, y)),
  ]

let light = vec2(32.0, 32.0)
var segments: seq[LineSegment]

# We need to add a rectangle as a bounding box for our rays. This is usually
# your window's bounding box, but if the light has attenuation and is drawn as a
# textured rectangle, the bounding box would be that rectangle
segments.add rectangle(0, 0, 800, 600)
# Then, we can add an object that will cast a shadow
segments.add rectangle(64, 64, 64, 64)
```

We can then use one of the two available APIs to get the triangles representing
the area lit by the light:

```nim
proc drawTriangle(tri: Triangle) =
  discard # triangle drawing magic goes here

# The iterator version
for tri in raycast(light, segments):
  drawTriangle(tri)

# The procedure version
let triangles = raycast(light, segments)
```

Which one you should choose depends on your use case:
- The procedure version can yield more performance. You can "bake" the lit area,
  and draw it until the light/segments update. Then you raycast again.
  This is most useful for static objects like props.
- The iterator version uses less memory, because it does not allocate a
  sequence. However, calling it each frame is going to be slower than caching
  the sequence returned by the procedure version. This is most useful for
  dynamic objects like sprites.

Here's a complete example using rapid with the iterator version:

```nim
import delight
import rapid/gfx

proc rectangle(x, y, w, h: float): array[4, LineSegment] =
  result = [
    (a: vec2(x, y),         b: vec2(x + w, y)),
    (a: vec2(x + w, y),     b: vec2(x + w, y + h)),
    (a: vec2(x + w, y + h), b: vec2(x, y + h)),
    (a: vec2(x, y + h),     b: vec2(x, y)),
  ]

var segments: seq[LineSegment]

segments.add rectangle(0, 0, 800, 600)
segments.add rectangle(64, 64, 64, 64)

var
  win = initRWindow()
    .size(800, 600)
    .title("example")
    .open()
  surface = win.openGfx()

surface.loop:
  draw ctx, step:
    ctx.clear(gray(0))
    ctx.begin()
    let light = vec2(win.mouseX, win.mouseY)
    for tri in raycast(light, segments):
      ctx.tri((tri.a.x, tri.a.y), (tri.b.x, tri.b.y), (tri.c.x, tri.c.y))
    ctx.draw()
  update: discard
```

The library also exposes some lower-level procedures, namely `intersect` and
`findIntersection`. These can be used to implement a DOOM-like raycasting
renderer. Refer to the documentation for details on what these procedures do.
